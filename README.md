### Project Overview
This project focuses on conducting a data analysis to identify and categorize different customer segments. Through this analysis, we aim to uncover valuable insights that will inform targeted marketing strategies and enhance customer engagement. The outcome of this segmentation will enable more personalized approaches, ultimately driving business growth and improving customer satisfaction.

### Understanding Customer Segmentation
Customer Segmentation is a typical strategy used by organizations to categorize clients based on their demographics, shopping patterns, or other traits. This practice is essential for understanding the diverse needs and preferences of the customer base, allowing businesses to tailor their products, services, and marketing efforts more effectively

### Why I Carried Out Data Analysis on Segmentation
By adopting this approach, businesses can;
- Have a deeper understanding of their target audience.
- Develop targeted solutions that meet the unique needs of each segment.
- Enhance customer satisfaction and loyalty by understanding their specific requirements.
- Identify new business opportunities and untapped markets.
- Optimize resource allocation and improve operational efficiency.
- Improve customer retention and reduce churn by tailoring experiences to each segment
- leading to long-term success and growth.

### Project Objective:
By conducting this project, you'll be able to leverage SQL's querying capabilities to segment
customers effectively. This will not only enhance your technical skills in data analysis but also
provide actionable insights that can drive business decisions. Whether you're aiming to
personalize marketing efforts, improve customer service, or optimize inventory management,
this project offers a solid foundation for understanding and applying customer segmentation in a
real-world retail context.


### Understanding Dataset:
The [Retail Dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dZUHD7zdExFFzuDWcTE9bBqsdOERpTWo/view) provides a view of customersâ€™ transactions, allowing for in-depth analysis
and segmentation. This dataset contains the following variables:
- InvoiceNo: The invoice number for each transaction
- StockCode: The unique code for each product sold
- Description: The description of each product sold
- Quantity: The quantity of each product sold in each transaction
- InvoiceDate: The date and time of each transaction
- UnitPrice: The price of each product sold
- CustomerID: The unique identifier for each customer
- Country: The country where each transaction occurred

### Process of Analysis
1. Downloaded the CSV file containing the raw data.
2. Created a database to store and manage the data efficiently.
3. Created a table within the database using Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio.
4. Loaded the data from the CSV file into the database table.
5.  [Cleaned the data](https://github.com/Lightstone1/Customer-Segmentation/blob/main/Data%20Cleaning.sql) by removing duplicates and addressing inconsistencies to enhance overall data quality.
6.  Analyzed the cleaned data to extract meaningful insights.
7.  Provided recommendations based on the analysis to support informed decision-making.

### Insights I discovered
I was able to discover the following insights after analysing:
- What is the distribution of order values across all customers in the dataset?
- How many unique products have each customer purchased?
- Which customers have only made a single purchase from the company?
- Which products are most commonly purchased together by customers in the
dataset?
